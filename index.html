    <div>

        <p>Sea animals are fascinating creatures that live in oceans, seas, and other saltwater bodies around the world.
            They come in all shapes and sizes, from tiny plankton to massive blue whales—the largest animals on Earth.
            These creatures play a vital role in the marine ecosystem, helping to keep the balance of nature. Some sea
            animals, like dolphins and octopuses, are known for their intelligence, while others, like jellyfish and
            starfish, amaze us with their unique forms and behaviors. <br><br>

            Many sea animals have special features that help them survive in their watery environment. For example, fish
            have gills to breathe underwater, while crabs and lobsters have hard shells to protect their bodies. Some
            animals, like squids and cuttlefish, can change their color to blend in with their surroundings and escape
            predators. Others, like sharks, have excellent senses that allow them to detect even the smallest movements
            in the water. <br><br>

            The ocean is also home to beautiful and colorful creatures like coral, seahorses, and clownfish, which are
            often found in coral reefs. These underwater environments are full of life and are important for
            biodiversity. Unfortunately, sea animals face many threats from human activities such as overfishing,
            pollution, and climate change. Plastic waste, in particular, is a serious danger to marine life, as many
            animals mistake it for food and suffer as a result. <br><br>

            Protecting sea animals and their habitats is essential for the health of our planet. Oceans provide
            oxygen,regulate climate, and support the livelihoods of millions of people. By reducing pollution, using
            resources wisely, and supporting marine conservation, we can help ensure that sea animals continue to thrive
            in their natural environment. Their beauty and importance remind us of the wonders of nature and our
            responsibility
            to care for it

        <h2 id="sea-wonders">Sea Wonders</h2>

        <p>
            The sea is full of breathtaking wonders that continue to amaze scientists, explorers, and nature lovers
            alike. Covering more than 70% of the Earth’s surface, the ocean hides countless mysteries beneath its waves.
            From glowing creatures in the deep sea to massive coral reefs teeming with life, the wonders of the sea
            remind us how little we truly know about our planet. The sea is not just a source of beauty but also a place
            of incredible scientific interest. <br><br>

            One of the most remarkable sea wonders is the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, the largest coral reef system
            in the world. Stretching over 2,300 kilometers, it is home to thousands of marine species, including
            colorful fish, sea turtles, and unique corals. Coral reefs like this one are often called the "rainforests
            of the sea" because of their rich biodiversity. Another incredible sea wonder is bioluminescence—when
            certain sea creatures like jellyfish and plankton produce glowing light, lighting up the water at night in a
            magical display. <br><br>

            The deep sea, which remains largely unexplored, holds some of the most mysterious sea wonders. Strange and
            alien-like creatures live in complete darkness, surviving in extreme pressure and cold temperatures.
            Hydrothermal vents found on the ocean floor release hot, mineral-rich water, supporting unique ecosystems
            that exist nowhere else on Earth. These discoveries show how life can thrive even in the harshest
            conditions, and they expand our understanding of biology and evolution. <br><br>

            Sea wonders are not only natural marvels but also vital to life on Earth. Oceans help regulate the climate,
            produce oxygen, and provide food for billions of people. Yet, they are under constant threat from pollution,
            climate change, and overfishing. To protect the wonders of the sea for future generations, we must act
            responsibly and support ocean conservation efforts. Exploring and preserving the sea's wonders allows us to
            appreciate the beauty and complexity of the world beneath the waves.
